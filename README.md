Unifier</h1>
<p align=center>A "simple" bot to unite Discord servers with webhooks, brought to you by Green and ItsAsheer<br>
Inspired by matrix-t2bot</p>

## Why did I make Unifier?
Some time ago, my friends and acquaintances and I had some game that we all played. We used to hang out often it its official 
community Discord server, however we could only talk about the game or its themes only in there. This heavily limited what we 
could talk about, so I decided to make Unifier.

Instead of having to go through the tedious process of adding everyone into one server, Unifier allows us to bring our servers 
together and chat about anything civil together as if it was one big server.

## What can Unifier do?
Unifier "bridges" participating servers' messages to all other participating servers, so if one person sends something, then 
others from different servers can see it and reply to it. This is done by using Discord's webhooks feature.

Unifier's chat experience, which we call Unified Chat (or UniChat for short), was designed to be as native as possible, so 
chatting in Unified Chat feels almost completely identical to chatting normally with server members. Unlike some other bots, 
almost all visuals of the conventional chat experience are preserved, so users can easily get used to talking in Unified Chat.

<em>Unifier's actual chat experience</em>

UniChat is also more **raid and nuke resistant**, as one server going down doesn't mean the entire chat will. In case of a raid, 
a server restriction, whether it be server-side or global is all it takes to stop the raid right away, as whatever happens in 
there won't be forwarded when restricted. Restrictions don't delete or ban users, so any unintended restrictions can be revoked 
right away. No member rejoin or anything required.
